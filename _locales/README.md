# Localization and Language Support in modcore Extension Manager

We have decided **not to localize or translate** the full interface of **modcore Extension Manager** at this time. Localization would require a significant amount of ongoing effort, and since the extension is still under active development - with frequent changes to elements, structure, and features - maintaining consistent translations is not practical for us right now.

## Future Plans

We have considered the possibility of including localization in the future, either:

- as part of a final update, if we eventually discontinue active development, or
- once we reach a more stable point in the project,
- or if the team grows and we have fewer core features left to implement.

In such cases, we would aim to include support for as many languages as possible. However, we cannot guarantee this, as it depends on many factors, including project direction, workload, and available resources.

## FAQ

### Why are there language files included already?

The language files (currently available for English, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and French) are included specifically to localize the **extension description**. This description helps users from different regions understand the purpose and features of the extension in their native language. Since this text is stable and rarely changes, maintaining translations is practical and ensures broader accessibility for users worldwide.

Additionally, this setup allows third-party developers or modders to build upon the extension and add their own translations if they choose to do so.

### Will more languages be added in the future?

Possibly. This depends on multiple factors: how the project evolves, whether localization becomes more manageable, the size of the user base, and the available capacity within the team.

Our intention is to support as many languages as possible — but this is not a commitment. It's equally possible that we’ll support fewer languages than expected if priorities shift.

### Can I contribute a translation?

At this time, we do not have a formal process for accepting community translations. However, if you're interested in localizing the extension or helping prepare language files, feel free to reach out or fork the repository to contribute independently.
